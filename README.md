# Workers Demo

This is a workers Demo project that utilizes Micro Frontends with workers (linked below).

## Key concepts

- Lit Element
- Vaadin Router
- Lit Context
- Lit Tasks

### Known Issues

- in this example, I use localStorage. This has known caps for data limits, I am in the process of moving this to use IndexDb so it will scale better and account for better offline use. because of this limitation, you may see an `Aw snap` screen in chrome when cycling through movies.
